abstract classes:
  Abstract classes are classes of which no object is instantiated and serves only as a blueprint for other classes to inherit.
  They are similar to interfaces but methods and variables can have access modifiers.
  
abstract methods:
  Abstract methods are methods that are declared but not implemented.
  
 final keyword:
  Used with variables, methods, classes, and objects. Final variables cannot be changed. Final methods are non-overridable.
  Final classes are non-extendable. Final objects' reference cannot be changed.
  
 inner classes:
   A class within another class including static, local, nested, and anonymous.
  
 static inner class:
   Belongs to its outer class, not objects created of that class.
    
 local class:
   Class declared and defined inside a method.
    
  nested class:
    Nested class --> static (does not have access to outer class).
                 --> non-static "inner class" (has access to outer class even if private).
  
  anonymous inner class:
    Unnamed local class.
   
  lamda expression:
    Can be considered an anonymous method. Used to pass functionality as argument for another method.
